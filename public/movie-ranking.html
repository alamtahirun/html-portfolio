       <h1>The Best Films of All Time by Tahirun Alam Rakib </h1>
<h2>The Top 3</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Mean Streets</h3>
<p>It doesn't take me a moment of reflection to mention this film when someone asks me what my favourite film is. Not the best film by 
    Scorsese, but the film that is closest to my heart.</p>

<h3>The Wind Rises</h3>
<p>My favourite Ghibli film. The character's passion for his craft inspires me to this day and is one of the most important 
    films for me.</p>
    
<h3>La Dolce Vita</h3>
<p>A masterpiece that needs no explaination.</p>
